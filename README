ABOUT

The Ono List Pager is a flexible plugin that creates a web UI that enables the user to navigate through a list of elements (like an <ul>). It provides different types of paging navigation. The onoPager is built in such a way that it's easy to add your own animation objects without having to rewrite the basic paging functionality.
